# About the game

The Hardcore Frogger Experience is my own personal take on the classic arcade game Frogger from the 1990's

The objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible, without being hit by a bug at which point will reduce the players point count to zero or minus 10 points per death if they are already at zero or below points.

Gems will spawn and disappear on a timer so the gems always spawn randomly.
The star will will only spawn on the top row but has a low chance of spawning, when spawned it will not disappear until collected by the player

Points and high scores are recorded on the users localStorage of their browser.
A global high score is also recorded on a server provided by Google's Firebase
