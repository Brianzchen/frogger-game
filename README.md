How to play the game
===============================

This player will collect points and try to cross the tiles, if they manage to cross the tiles they are awarded points
if they die they will lose all their points, but the game continues. 

If the player already has 0 or less points, instead of reverting the player to no points, the player will lose an aditional
10 points per death

Objects will spawn periodically in the game which the player can collect to earn more points, if the player reaches a 
theshold of points the gems will change color and award more points.

The gems do not always stay the same point and jump around periodically. The star will spawn less 
frequently but will offer more points and does not move unless collected.
